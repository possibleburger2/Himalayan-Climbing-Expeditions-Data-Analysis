# Model Card: Bayesian Logistic Regression for Climbing Success Prediction

## Overview
This Bayesian logistic regression model predicts the probability of success in Himalayan climbing expeditions based on climbers' demographic and expedition characteristics. It uses historical data from expeditions, peaks, and climbers.

## Intended Use
### Purpose:
- Analyze factors influencing climbing success.
- Explore the significance of variables like age, oxygen use, and season in predicting summit outcomes.

### Users:
- Researchers studying mountaineering patterns.
- Policy advisors assessing safety measures for expeditions.

### Out-of-Scope Use:
- Real-time decision-making during climbs.
- Predicting success for specific individuals without accounting for real-time conditions.

## Data and Inputs
### Data Sources:
- **Expeditions Data:** Includes details about the expeditions (e.g., year, season).
- **Members Data:** Contains climber-specific details (e.g., age, citizenship).
- **Peaks Data:** Provides information about mountain characteristics (e.g., height in meters).

### Data Preprocessing:
1. Created average age and previous attempts from members data and combined those columns with expeditions.
2. Split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets using `rsample::initial_split()`.

### Input Variables:
- **Predictors:** Average age, members, oxygen use, season, height of peak attempted, previous attempts.
- **Outcome Variable:** Binary indicator of success (1 = summit reached, 0 = no summit).

## Model Details
### Architecture:
- Bayesian logistic regression implemented in R using `glm()`.

### Training Data:
- 80% of the combined dataset (~training set size determined during preprocessing).

### Key Features:
- **Formula:** `success ~ success ~ average_age + members  + oxygen_used
               + height_attempted + previous_attempts`
- Two models were evaluated:
  - **Model 1:** Included hired_staff, season, year.
  - **Model 2 (Final):** Excluded hired_staff, season, year for simplicity and interpretability.

### Performance:
- **Odds Ratios (OR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI):** Calculated for model coefficients.
- Comparison with ANOVA test for model selection.

## Ethical Considerations
### Bias:
- Age represented as purely detrimental to success despite non linear relationship in data
### Limitations:
- Does not account for real-time weather, route conditions, or climbersâ€™ fitness on the day of the climb.
- May generalize poorly to newer peaks with limited historical data.
